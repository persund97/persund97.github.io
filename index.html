									<h2>Showcase</h2>

								<p>
									For three years, I studied game development at a folk high school in Sweden. 
									The year after, I began my career at an IT consulting company as a Unity developer. 
									This page is a collection of my work throughout the years.
									I downloaded the template for this website from HTML5up, but I modified it extensively using my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

												<h3>Flykten Från Gävle</h3>
												<p class="descriptionTitle">Ädelfors Folkhögskola <br> 2021 - 2021</p>
												<p class="descriptionText">
													I worked as a UI and menu designer and programmer on this two-day project. <br><br>
													In this 2D platformer game, you play as the famous Gävle Goat, 
													and the objective is to run away from a devastating fire. <br><br>
													I built the main menu from scratch, using pre-made images 
													and my programming skills to give the buttons functionality. 
													Additionally, I added a particle effect system to the menu and placed it above the panels. 
													I also created the health bar, located at the top left of the game screen.

												<h3>Happy Pizza Friends</h3>
												<p class="descriptionTitle">Ädelfors Folkhögskola <br> 2021 - 2021</p>
												<p class="descriptionText">
													I worked as a programmer and designer on this three-day project. <br><br>
													The protagonist, a cute scooter bear, is stuck inside a pizza world, 
													and the player's objective is to catch falling pizza slices to keep the bear alive. <br><br>
													I contributed to nearly every aspect of the game. 
													I created a pizza slice spawner with an object pool and randomized falling speed, 
													positioned above the viewport. 
													I also implemented a system where the bear grows and shrinks based on the number of pizzas collected. 
													The pizzas at the bottom are simple 2D sprites that change according to an integer value storing the number of collected pizzas. 
													Lastly, I animated the humorous organs that fly out when the bear explodes and created the image that appears at the bottom right and the credits screen.

													I worked as a game programmer and designer on this five-week project. <br><br>
													In this first-person fighting game, the player navigates through mazes, avoids traps, kills enemies, and passes through portals. <br><br>
													My tasks included writing functions for character movement using WASD keys, crouch and jump movements, mouse rotation, and combat with the left mouse button. 
													I also created the sword animation, health bar, and functions for picking up health potions and taking damage from lava.

												<h3>Cyber Claus</h3>
												<p class="descriptionTitle">Ädelfors Folkhögskola <br> 2020 - 2020</p>
												<p class="descriptionText">
													I worked as a game programmer and UI designer on this five-day project. <br><br>
													In this 2D platformer game, the player avoids traps and viruses in a cyber-themed environment to reach the goal at the end of the map.
													I developed the character controls and shooting mechanics. 
													The shooting mechanic is a simple object pool that sets a force and quantity for the snowballs. 
													The gift bombs activate on key press, count down, and explode to kill nearby enemies. 
													I used Rigidbody to create the character's movement and implemented rotation for the character when pressing the A and D keys. 
													The arm also rotates towards the player's aim. I created the gingerbread hearts (the player's life) at the top right, adjusting the life count based on a value.

												<h3>Noble's Forest Dump</h3>
												<p class="descriptionTitle">Ädelfors Folkhögskola <br> 2020 - 2020</p>
												<p class="descriptionText">
													I worked as a game programmer and designer on this five-week project. <br><br>
													In this 2D game, you play as a cute squirrel tasked with completing mini-games to save the world from brutal climate changes.
													My primary task was to create the trash bin mini-game, which is similar to Tetris.
													I replicated the classic game's controls, allowing the player to drop trash pieces that fall step by step within a grid.
													The items collide with each other, and the game ends when the trash reaches the top.
													I also developed the score system displayed at the top of the screen and the acorns that appear after each game over, with the sprite's fill amount increasing based on the score.
													This was my first experience with data storage, and I wrote a function to save the high score to a local file.

												<h3>Unity Development</h3>
												<p class="descriptionTitle">Mindflower AB <br> 2023 - 2023</p>
												<p class="descriptionText">
													During my employment, I had the opportunity to work in a small team to create mobile applications for various companies. <br><br>
													Our main goal was to help customers visualize data using the Unity game engine. 
													As a Unity developer, my tasks included implementing new designs, ranging from UI/UX to solving complex bugs. 
													We utilized quick prototypes and extreme programming, working in two-week short sprint schedules with a demo of the results. <br><br>
													In summary, my tasks were to: <br>
													* Implement given designs for the projects <br>
													* Use Scrum methodology to estimate and structure my tasks during the sprint <br>
													* Use Unity as the main tool for development, with Visual Studio as the programming software <br>
													* Quickly create prototypes with extreme programming <br>
													* Program and gather data with WebSockets
